# Docker read only volume
=========================

Docker provides a way to create read-only volumes, which can be useful for scenarios where you want to share data with containers without allowing them to modify the data. This is particularly useful for configuration files, static assets, or any data that should not be changed by the container.

## Creating a Read-Only Volume

To create a read-only volume in Docker, you can use the `-v` or `--mount` flag when running a container. Here's how to do it:
```bash
docker run -d -v my_readonly_volume:/data:ro my_image
```
# In this command:
- `my_readonly_volume` is the name of the volume you want to create or use.
- `/data` is the path inside the container where the volume will be mounted.    
- `:ro` specifies that the volume should be mounted as read-only, preventing any modifications to the data inside the volume.
- `my_image` is the Docker image you are using to create the container.
