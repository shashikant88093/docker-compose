# Docker Data Types
## Docker uses various data types to manage containers, images, networks, and volumes.
# Here are some of the key data types used in Docker:

- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers. They contain the application code, libraries, and dependencies required to run an application. Images can be built from a Dockerfile or pulled from a registry like Docker Hub.
- **Containers**: Instances of images that can be run, stopped, and managed. Containers are isolated environments that run applications. They can be started, stopped, and removed independently of each other.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage used by containers to store data that needs to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. Volumes are stored outside the container's filesystem and can be shared between containers. They are useful for storing databases, configuration files, and other data that needs to be retained.
- **Networks**: Virtual networks that allow containers to communicate with each other. Docker provides several network drivers, such as bridge, host, and overlay, to manage container networking. Networks can be used to isolate containers, enable communication between them, and connect containers to external networks.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and configuration needed to create an image. Dockerfiles are used to automate the image-building process.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define services, networks, and volumes required for an application. Docker Compose simplifies the management of complex applications by allowing users to define all components in a single file.
- **Docker Registry**: A storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but users can also set up private registries. Registries allow users to share images with others and pull images from remote locations.
