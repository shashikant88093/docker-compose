# What is Container?
- Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that it runs consistently across different computing environments.
- They provide a way to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments, which helps to avoid conflicts between different applications and their dependencies.
- This isolation makes it easier to develop, test, and deploy software, as developers can focus on their application code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure or dependencies.
- Containers can be easily moved between different environments, such as development, testing, and production,
  allowing for consistent behavior across these environments.
- The container is running "unit of software" that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
- Containers are created from images, which are read-only templates that define the container's content and configuration.
