# What is image?
# - An image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
# - Images are built from a set of instructions defined in a Dockerfile, which specifies how to assemble the image.
# - Images can be shared and distributed through container registries, allowing developers to easily share their applications and their dependencies.
# - When a container is created from an image, it becomes a running instance of that image, with its own isolated filesystem and environment.
# - Images can be versioned, allowing developers to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
